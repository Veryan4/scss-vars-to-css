# scss-vars-to-css
Convert SCSS variables to CSS variables

Forked from: https://github.com/samuelthomps0n/sass-to-css-variables

This was made to speed up Angular Projects using SCSS variables. By using CSS global variables instead, you no longer require to import SCSS files into each component, which can reduce bundle size significantly over a large project.

Does not convert Mixins
